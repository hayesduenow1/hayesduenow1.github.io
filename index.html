        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology/Law & SocietyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-year sociology student with a passion for understanding the complexities of human society and a commitment to advocating for social justice. With a background in volunteer work and a deep interest in the cultural and societal structures that shape our world, I am embarking on an academic journey that promises to be as enlightening as it is impactful. 

Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology at University of California â€“ Riverside, my academic focus lies in exploring the dynamics of social relationships, cultural norms, and systemic inequalities. Though I am only in my first year, I have already engaged in coursework that examines social theory, research methods, and the role of institutions in shaping individual behavior.

Before starting university, I was actively involved in various community projects and non-profit organizations. My experiences volunteering at local food banks, mentoring underprivileged youth, and participating in neighborhood clean-up initiatives have significantly influenced my perspective on social issues. These hands-on experiences not only solidified my commitment to social justice but also provided me with a practical understanding of the societal challenges many people face.<br><br>

        As I progress through my sociology program, I aim to deepen my understanding of social inequalities and explore potential solutions. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in law, where I can contribute to policy development and community outreach. I am particularly interested in issues related to race, gender, and economic inequality, and hope to work with organizations that address these critical topics.

My professional aspirations are closely tied to my academic interests. I am eager to participate in research projects, internships, and fieldwork that will allow me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world situations. I also plan to join student organizations and clubs that focus on social issues, providing me with additional opportunities to network with like-minded individuals and develop my leadership skills.<br><br>

        Outside of my academic and volunteer work, I am an avid reader and enjoy exploring literature that delves into social and cultural themes. I also have a passion for the arts, frequently attending local theater productions and art exhibitions. These interests complement my studies in sociology, offering me a broader perspective on human creativity and expression.


I am known among my peers for my empathetic nature and strong sense of justice. I am always ready to lend a listening ear and am passionate about helping others find their voice. As I continue my studies, I am excited to learn from my professors and classmates, and to contribute my own unique insights to the field of sociology.
